// Route - The Route component is perhaps the most important component in React Router to understand and learn to use well. Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when a location matches the routeâ€™s path.
// BrowserRouter - A <Router> that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
// Switch - Renders the first child <Route> or <Redirect> that matches the location.
  // <Switch> is unique in that it renders a route exclusively. In contrast, every <Route> that matches the location renders inclusively.
// Link - Provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application.
// NavLink - A special version of the <Link> that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.
